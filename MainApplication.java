 * Place 100!
 * Main Application
 *
 * This program is a very simple grid game where the player tries to place all
 * 100 digits onto the grid following a set of restrictions to placement.
 * 
 * The restrictions and rules are available to the player by using the help
 * button when inside the game.
 * 
 * I did not invent this game but merely digitalized it.
 * 
 * I am still a bit new to game design so my code can be a bit wonky.
 * 
 * Enjoy!
