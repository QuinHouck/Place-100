# Place-100
A grid game where the user tries to place all 100 digits

I did not create this game, I merely digitalized it.
I found the game from a YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qjq7d45hg4&t=333s&ab_channel=chycho

How to Play:
 - The goal is to place all 100 digits on the 10x10 grid.
 - There are two forms of movement:
    1. Up, Down, Left, or Right 3 spaces.
    2. Diagonally 2 spaces.
 - You can remove your previous square by clicking on it.
